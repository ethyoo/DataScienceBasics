# Data Science Basics at Rutgers University Libraries (Spring 2023)

As a Data Science Graduate Specialist for Rutgers University Libraries, I created these slide decks for the Spring 2023 Data Science Basics series.

I will upload the remaining slide decks during March and April 2023 as each standalone workshop occurs. You can register for upcoming workshops using the [Rutgers Libraries calendar system](https://libcal.rutgers.edu/calendar/nblworkshops).

Feel free to contact me with questions or comments using the contact information provided in the slides!
